                    <p>Throughout his life, John Decker has been obsessed by the moon. Each chapter take its title from one of the lunar seas...</p>


                    <div class="clearfix">

                        <h2 class="center">1: Sea of the Edge</h2>



                        <p>Christmas Eve: John Decker falls down the stairs at his isolated New Forest home, breaking both his legs.</p>

                        <p><img src="assets/images/stairs-mono.jpg" alt="stairs" class="flexible-width white-border">Lying in agony, he remembers being a young man in the Yorkshire town of Sketby and the previous time he fractured a leg, while drunkenly
                            celebrating being demobbed from the army. In hospital, the young Decker meets a young nurse, Laura.</p>

                        <p>The old Decker crawls to the kitchen to get his phone &#8212; only to realise he has left it up in the loft while working on his model of the moon. With no other means of contacting the outside world, and no friends or family to
                            care about him, he faces the prospect that he might die without knowing what happened to his wife Laura and daughter Zoe.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="white-block center">
                        <h2>2: Sea of Nectar</h2>
                        <p>A desperate Decker contemplates his fate.</p>

                        <p>While out with his friend Dave, the young Decker meets Laura again and a romance blossoms. He soon meets Laura's boorish brother-in-law, Brian, who  seems to have a fixation with her.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2 class="center">3: Sea of Fecundity</h2>


                    <p>Decker makes a pair of splints from and old mop and attempts an agonising ascent of the stairs to get his heart pills.</p>

                    <p>Laura tells the young Decker that he is to become a father. After Zoe is born, the three of them live with Decker's parents, causing strain on their marriage. Decker finds a dilapadated old home on the edge of Sketby
                        Moor and begins renovating it, but the marital problems continue. He has a fling with Peggy, a woman he meets while working as a TV repairman.</p>



                    <div class="white-block center">
                        <h2>4: Ocean of Storms</h2>
                        <p>After returning from a cycling trip, the young Decker finds Laura and Zoe have gone missing from their moorside home. His policeman pal Dave tries to reassure him but it soon becomes clear that something terrible has happened.</p>

                    </div>


                    <h2 class="center">5: Sea of Crises</h2>


                    <p>Laura and Zoe have vanished without trace. Police treat Decker as the main suspect in their murder, but have no evidence to charge him. However, most of Sketby assumes his guilt &#8212; he loses his job and is beaten up by a gang of
                        thugs led by Brian. Distraught and disgusted, Decker decides to leave the town.</p>



                    <div class="white-block center">
                        <h2>6: Southern Sea</h2>
                        <p>Decker moves to Bournemouth, where he gets a job as a TV salesman. He buys the business from his boss and builds it up to be a great success, while still campaigning for the case into his wife and daughter's disappearance to
                            be reopened.</p>

                    </div>


                    <h2 class="center">7: Sea of Cold</h2>


                    <p>At his father's funeral, Decker meets Dave again and persuades him to provide the case files of other people questioned over Laura and Zoe's abduction. He is given the names of four people &#8212; Blakely, Quill, Smyth and Bell.</p>



                    <div class="white-block center clearfix">
                        <h2>8: Sea of Serpents</h2>
                        <p><img src="/assets/images/moor-mono2.jpg" alt="moor" class="flexible-width dark-border">In a northern seaside town, Decker lures child molester Blakely into a trap and confronts him, only to discover the man is an unlikely culprit.
                            In London, he follows paedophile Quill and meets Hale, a broken man looking for the people who murdered his young son. During an interrogation, Hale leaves Quill with severe brain damage and then takes his own life.</p>

                        <p>While looking through a draw of old things, the elderly Decker finds a letter from Hale, warning how his anger and desire for justice may also destroy him.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2 class="center">9: Smyth's Sea</h2>


                    <p>Decker, now middle aged, tries in vain to trap Smyth, a wealthy scholar with a interest in the dark side of life. Smyth gives Decker the name of another suspect &#8212; serial offender Fenham.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, Decker begins a romance with Penny, one of his sales staff.</p>



                    <div class="white-block center">
                        <h2>10: Foaming Sea</h2>
                        <p>Decker tracks down Fenham and in a fit of rage beats him to a pulp. He also meets two other suspects: Brian, who has been leading a double life, and Bell, who is dying in a hospice. None of them appear to be involved in Laura and
                            Zoe's disappearance.</p>

                        <p>Increasingly angry and bitter, his relationship with Penny breaks down.</p>

                    </div>


                    <h2 class="center">11: Sea That Has Become Known</h2>


                    <p>Still in agony, and surrounded by memories of the past , Decker finallly realises who killed his wife and daughter. But to prove it, he will have to get out of the house. If he stays, he might die and never see justice.</p>


                    <div class="white-block center">
                        <h2>12: Sea of Showers</h2>
                        <p>Decker begins a tortuous crawl through the New Forest to the nearest road. Just a few hundred yards but it might as well be miles. And then it starts to rain...</p>

                    </div>


                    <h2 class="center">13: Sea of Cleverness</h2>


                    <p>Will the killer of Laura and Zoe Decker finally be caught?</p>



                    <div class="white-block center">
