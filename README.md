# The Crawl

This website is to promote a The Crawl, a thriller novel I’m writing, and will actually be used when the novel is complete. It's also the first project for my Full Stack Developer course.

## Brief

The course brief was to create a resposive website of four or five pages. I also wanted something that would give an accurate summary of the subtance and style of the book.

## Design

The site is responsive and mobile first. It largely follows the rules of thirds.

It presented a couple of issues. Firstly, it was always going to be quite a wordy site, so I needed a way to break those words up.  Pictures and headings weren’t going to be enough so I looked at changing the background colour in places and using different font sizes.

The second issue was that the design needed to be quite dark to reflect the fact that it’s not exacctly a cheery novel. But a monochrome site would just look dull so I had to experiment with colour schemes to find colours that worked together but still suggested darkness – I used [this colour picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) to help me with this. I used drop shadows on the white boxes to further suggest that sense of ‘eerieness’ and used appropriate fonts.

## Navigation/Layout

The site consists of:

* A home page – An intro to the site and a side panel on the author.

* The Plot – A chapter by chapter breakdown of the novel and a sidepanel with a timeline of the book’s events.

* Excerpts - a few passages from the book

* Opening – the entire first chapter of the novel. 

* Contact – a contact form for interested agents, publishers etc. As it was just a front-end project, this form does not send or process any data at present.

## Frameworks

The site uses Bootstrap 4, with a collapsible navbar. It also uses a couple of Google fonts.

## Build status

Complete, apart from the form, which doesn't work yet. I may also add some tranitions if I have time. And some of the text will changes after the book is edited.

## Deployment

To get it up and running it's just six five web pages, one css file and 12 images.
