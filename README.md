# The Crawl

This website is to promote a The Crawl, a thriller novel I’m writing, and will actually be used when the novel is complete. It's also the first project for my Full Stack Developer course.

## Brief

The course brief was to create a resposive website of four or five pages. I also wanted something that would give an accurate summary of the subtance and style of the book.

## Design

The site is responsive and mobile first. It largely follows the rules of thirds.

It's quite a wordy site, which is the reason for the 'misty' backgrounds to break up the content
The design is quite dark to reflect the fact that it’s not exacctly a cheery novel. 

## Navigation/Layout

The site consists of:

* A home page – An intro to the site and a side panel on the author.

* The Plot – A chapter by chapter breakdown of the novel and a sidepanel with a timeline of the book’s events.

* Excerpts - a few passages from the book

* Opening – the entire first chapter of the novel. 

* Contact – a contact form for interested agents, publishers etc. '

## Frameworks

The site uses Bootstrap 4, with a collapsible navbar. It also uses a couple of Google fonts.

## Build status

Complete, though the content will probably change when the book is finished.

## Testing

The site has been tested on different browsers and via responsinator.com

## Deployment

Can be run locally by just opening index.html. Or upload the files to a server. it's just six five web pages, one css file and 12 images that need hosting. The form works via EmailJs - so you would need an account

## License information

The design and structure is open source but all content of the novel is copyright of Richard Stainton.
