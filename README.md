This website is to promote a The Crawl, a thriller novel I’m writing, and will actually be used when the novel is complete.

It presented a couple of issues. Firstly, it was always going to be quite a wordy site, so I needed a way to break those words up.  Pictures and headings weren’t going to be enough so I looked at changing the background colour in places and using different font sizes.

The second issue was that the design needed to be quite dark to reflect the fact that it’s not exacctly a cheery novel. But a monochrome site would just look dull so I had to experiment with colour schemes to find colours that worked together but still suggested darkness – I used https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp to help me with this. I used drop shadows on the white boxes to further suggest that sense of ‘eerieness’ and used appropriate fonts.

The site is resposnsive abd mobile first using Bootstrap 4, with a collapsible navbar. It largely follows the rule of thirds.

It consists of:

A home page – An intro to the site and a side panel on the author.

The Plot – A chapter by chapter breakdown of the novel and a sidepanel with a timeline of the book’s events.

Excerpts - a few passages from the book

Opening – the entire first chapter of the novel. 

Contact – a contact form for interested agents, publishers etc. As it was just a front-end project, this form does not send or process any data at present.
